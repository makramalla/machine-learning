    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this application is mainly concerned about classification of donors, i.e. splitting the data into two sets, I would choose:\n",
    "1) Decision Trees\n",
    "2) Support Vector Machines\n",
    "3) Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)\n",
    "\n",
    "To elaborate on each model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "-Real world application: After some research it is quite clear that Decision Trees are usually used for Data Mining which is quite obvious. A different application would be for [Transient Stability Prediction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/336122/) which is basically used to  acquire measurements to improve an overall power system protection and its control.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-Strengths: The main strength I believe is in its simplicity. One could easily visualize the process of this model, while really understanding how it is working. Its parameters are also very easy to grasp and thus easy to play with in order to get the best results possible, especialy in situation where overfitting is highly possible such as in our data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "-Weakness: Based on the Decision's Tree [Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree#Advantages_and_disadvantages) this model does not handle small changes relatively well. It is also mentioned that it is often inaccurate, and thus is advised to use random forests instead. Lastly, although the process itself is easy to understand, the calculations might be quite complex to execute. \n",
    "\n",
    "-Reason for choice: One of the main reasons of choice is my current familiarity with this model and its a parameters. As a classifier, I believe a decision tree could get very good results in a proper amount of time.\n",
    "Secondly, when going throught the data set, we notice that we have several aspects that we have to go through to train the data to make our predictions, such as age, capital gain, hours/week etc. Thus, using the decision tree model in a form of random forrests could also be a good solution. It is worth mentioning however, that due to the fact that we are having a binary outcome i.e. either >50 or =<50, we may not have to go that far.\n",
    "I also think that due to the alarge data set, there will be a high possibility for overfitting which decision trees tend to create, thus having a model with paramters that could help us in avoiding that would be really efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Support Vector Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "-Real world application: As per the  this [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095741740600217X) SVM has been used for Credit Score Calculation. As per the paper, implementing SVM has achieved much better results when compared to decision trees and neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "-Strengths: I believe the main strengths of SVM is mainly in its parameters, that can control over and under fitting. Also, the use of kernels which can provide us with better results, especially for this application, since according to my understanding we can afford some acceptable margin of error which we can then fine tune using the C parameter that is available in this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Weakness: The main weakness of SVM is in its speed of its processes both in the training and testing phases. The model is really complex and would therefore produce decent results but it would take much more time to achieve it. \n",
    "\n",
    "-Reason for choice: The main reason for this choice is again due to my familiarity with model. Its parameters are also easy to understand and to use. I am convinced that this could get the best results when compared to both other models, but I guess it is too early to assume that.\n",
    "Additionally, as discussed before it is quite obviouse from his application that a relatively high margin of error could be acceptable, i.e. I believe that it would still be acceptable to send some donation requests to individuals that make less or equal to 50k annualy.In the real world you might get actually get some responses from different people with different incomes. Thus I believe that we can easily utilize the C factor in the SVM model to allow a higher margin of errorwith no \"life-threatening\" outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)\n",
    "\n",
    "-Real world application: After some research, it is clear that naive bayes is usually used for document classification (also Spam e-mail detection). It works basically by categorizing the provided text or documents based on its texts. \n",
    "\n",
    "-Strengths: This model has a very simple process with a smaller data set and thus it is very effective in non-complex application since it relies mainly on possibility-based-predictions by grouping different aspects or events together. In this data set for example it would compine several of the individual's aspects together in order to form a prediction based in these apsects occuring together for the same individual. \n",
    "\n",
    "-Weakness: since this is a simple process, the main disadvantage is that it would not get best result when handling a large amount of data. This model would be more effective on a smaller set of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Reason for choice: This model was chosen dues to the fact that we already implemented it in this project. It would be interesting to compare the scores between the optimized model and the baseline model we calculated earlier. However, it is worth mentioning that I believe that both the decision tree and the SVM would be more effective and would have better results.\n",
    "Moreover, since this data set has a lot of variables namely the individual's aspects, the Naive Bayes will be able to efficiently make prediction of a persons income based on several of the aspects occuring together. As an example, if we assume that a person older than 40 years who works more than 40 hours/week and has a have a high educational number would usually make more than 50k per year, this model would be able to capture the same comclusion by grouping these factors together and make pretty smart predictions. Over all and to conclude, I believe that one would usually use a similair techniques when only looking at the data (or at least I did) thus I believe that this would work well in that setting.\n"

    "After Examining the graphs created above, I believe I will go with the Decision Tree Algorithm for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Metrics and Scores: When examining the score one would easily notice that both the decision tree and the SVC have achieved acceptable results. Both had similar high accuracy scores for training and predicting process. The F-score of both models are also quite high a much more efficient than the Gaussian model especially when comparing a bigger number of data. It is worth mentioning that the SVC has slightly better results, which I have disqualified due to its prediction/training time, which will be thoroughly discusses in this next aspect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction/Training Time: First of all I had some problems plotting the time on the graph, which is why I decided to print it out until I am able to find the issue. When comparing the time difference between the two narrowed down algorithms it is very easy to see the huge time difference between both. The prediction and training time of the Decision Tree is around 0.5 seconds and for the SVC it's around 300 seconds! This time will increase more and more when adding more data to the model, thus the SVC is disqualified as a suitable algorithm from my point of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suitability of Algorithm: Decision Trees are Classification Models. As discussed before it is widely being used for medical diagnosis and general failure predictions. It works by basically categorizing the data one step at the time by relying on specific categorization aspects. It also has important parameters such as max_depth, min_sample leafes, max_leaf_nodes, etc, that would help us in getting the best results possible\n"

    "When compared to the features discussed in Question 6, 4 out of the 5  features are the same as the ones displayed in the visualization. I will discuss each  feature in their actual rank based on this output, and will discuss the different feature as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Capital-loss: As previously assumed, the capital loss should have a decent impact on the individual's income, in this case the biggest impact, namely it would be reversely proportional as expected. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Age: Age or Experience does have a direct impact as well, although I expected it to be a bit lower in the ranking. The more experience the higher the income. Its high impact is not surprising as most of us can notice in our work places.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Capital-gain: Again as discussed, the capital gain should have a good impact on the individual's income, namely it would be proportional as expected. Although it does not have the biggest impact as I expected, it would still strongly affect the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Hours-pre-week: Again, the more you work the more income you should have. This feature from my perspective is very obvious although I thought that would have a higher rank. It is noticeable however that experience is a more important variable than working hours as displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) education-num: In Question 6 I chose educational level, but when exploring the results, I believe that education-num would have been a better choice. The educational level had too many options when compared to the more continues educational level, that at the end of the day tries to describe the similar aspect. all in all it is refreshing the educational level has a good impact on a person's income\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
